Create a group to contains all snippets for Visual Studio Code's Terminal. These snippets should not be used in other places of Visual Studio Code. These snippets can be used in other applications though.\n2. Configure that group's \"Applications Config\" for Visual Studio Code's Terminal.\n\nThis sample group \"Visual Studio Code's Terminal\" is already configured for Visual Studio Code's Terminal.\nYou can copy this group's settings and paste into another group.\nYou can also duplicate this group and add your snippets to the duplicated group.\nIt is not recommended to use any sample group without duplicating/copying it.","10":"Introduction","13":1663240512}
